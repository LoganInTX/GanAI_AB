I'm Logan, a 35-year-old who loves staying up-to-date on current events and the latest technology. I'm passionate about renewable energy and always looking for new ways to be eco-friendly.

When I'm not reading about the world, I love being active. I play tennis, golf, and snow ski, and I'm always up for a good hike. I'm also a big sports fan, especially football.

I'm looking for a woman who shares my interests and is as active as I am. Someone who's passionate about their career and wants to travel and try new restaurants. A woman who takes care of herself and is full of energy.

If you're out there, let's connect!
